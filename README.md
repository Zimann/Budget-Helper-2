# Budget Calculator

### Purpose of this project

  - This project has been been remodelled after a project (https://github.com/Zimann/Budget-Helper) that has the exact same functionalities.
  - The former project was created in a procedural way and every method was repositioned and restructured in an OOP manner.
  
  ### How can this project help you?
- It can help you to have a visual representation of your expenses and incomes.
- It can show you accurate percentages between income and expense sums, as well as individual calculated percentages for each income or expense entry.
- Last but not least, and this is perhaps the most important one but also maybe uncommon to think about: It can be a great __counter example__ that really shows how much code you have to write and how many variables you have to use just to keep track of different data changes, when this could be done automatically with __data binding__.
